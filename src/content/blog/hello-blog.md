Alright let's get this obligatory inaugural post out of the way y'all.

I've put off properly starting a blog for **_so long._** It's actually kind of embarrassing. I don't even have an original excuse, just all of the usual suspects. _No one will read it. I have nothing interesting to say. I'm too busy. What if people do read it but don't like it? What's it actually going to be about? What's the point?_ And so on. I know, lame as fuck.

In my defense, technically I did halfheartedly start a blog a few times over the last few years, but I never really committed. I chose a platform or framework, built out the basics, threw some words at the page a few times, then eventually neglected and abandoned it. All of those sabotaging excuses inevitably killed any momentum I was able to summon up in the first place. Or I would start overcomplicating things, or decide something else was more important.

Well, enough is enough. Depending on where you get your takes, it's either the best or worst time to be blogging (same as last year?), so when better to buck / embrace the trend and get this thing on the rails?

What can you expect to see here in the future? Follow me to find out together. I'd hate to spoil the surprise.
