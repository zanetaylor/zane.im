description: Blogging is dead, right?
---
I find the take that blogging is uncool and dead in 2023 powerful motivation to relaunch mine. Call me whatever neckbeard adjacent name seems most fitting, but the ugly truth is that I truly do miss parts of the web of 10-15 years ago. A rougher, weirder, less approachable, and far less commercialized thing.
